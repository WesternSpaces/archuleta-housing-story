# Housing in Archuleta County: Follow the Story

*An interactive guide to understanding our housing challenge*

---

## Introduction

Housing policy can feel abstract—full of acronyms, statistics, and policy jargon. But behind every number is a person, a family, a business trying to make it work here.

This story follows four households through the data. They're not real people, but they represent real situations in our community. As you read, consider: **Which household's story resonates with you?**

> **What's AMI?** You'll see "AMI" throughout—that's Area Median Income. It's the middle point of all household incomes in our area. For Archuleta County in 2025, 100% AMI for a 2-person household is $81,600/year. Housing programs use AMI to determine who qualifies. Housing is considered "affordable" when you spend no more than 30% of income on it.

## About This Process

This story is part of the **Archuleta County & Town of Pagosa Springs Housing Action Plan** process. We're working to understand our housing challenges and develop solutions together.

### ⓘ What's a Housing Needs Assessment?
- Identifies the type and amount of housing needed at all income levels
- Completed April 2025 for Archuleta County
- Analyzes demographics, economics, housing inventory, and market conditions
- **Not a mandate** — it's an informational tool to guide planning

### ⓘ What's a Housing Action Plan?
- Turns the Needs Assessment into action
- Sets goals and strategies specific to our community
- Required by Colorado law (SB 24-174) by January 2028
- Shaped by community input — **that's why we're here**

## Chapter 1: Meet Your Neighbors

### Anna: The Healthcare Worker

**Who she is:** Anna is 34, a Certified Nursing Assistant at Pagosa Springs Medical Center. She's been here five years, loves the community, and is great at her job. She earns $42,000 a year—about 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI).

**Her situation:** Anna rents a one-bedroom apartment and works extra shifts when she can. She's looked at buying, but the math doesn't work. She's considered leaving for Durango, where some of her coworkers commute from, but she doesn't want to spend two hours a day in a car.

**What she can afford:**
- Maximum rent: $1,050/month (30% of income)
- Maximum home price: Out of reach

---

### Mike & Jenny: The Young Family

**Who they are:** Mike and Jenny are in their late 30s with two kids in elementary school. Mike is a deputy sheriff ($70,000), Jenny is a part-time teacher ($32,000). Combined household income: $102,000—about 100% AMI for a family of four.

**Their situation:** They've been renting a three-bedroom house for six years. The landlord just told them he's selling—and the new owner may not keep it as a rental. They've started looking to buy, but even at 100% AMI, they can't afford the median home.

**What they can afford:**
- Maximum rent: $2,550/month
- Maximum home price: ~$385,000

---

### Linda & Tom: The Retiring Couple

**Who they are:** Linda, 67, taught at Pagosa Springs schools for 30 years. Tom, 69, worked various jobs in the county. They live on combined pensions and Social Security—about $65,000/year, roughly 80% AMI.

**Their situation:** Linda and Tom own a 3-bedroom home worth $450,000, but it's more house than they need now. They'd like to downsize to something smaller and more accessible—maybe a condo or smaller home—and free up a family home for the market. But there's nothing available under $350,000.

*If they could downsize, they'd free up a family home for the market. But they can't find their next place.*

**What they could afford:**
- Maximum rent: $1,625/month
- Maximum home price: ~$245,000 (if they downsized)

---

### Pat & Chris: The Restaurant Owners

**Who they are:** Pat and Chris have run a restaurant downtown for twelve years. They're not looking for housing themselves—they own their home. But they can't find workers.

**Their situation:** Last summer, they had to close two days a week because they couldn't staff the kitchen. Line cooks, servers, dishwashers—they all need housing, and there's nothing available. When they do find applicants, many back out once they see rental prices.

**The impact:** "We've turned away business. We've shortened hours. It's not a labor problem—it's a housing problem."

## Chapter 2: The Math Doesn't Work

Let's follow each household through the affordability calculation.

### How "Affordable" Is Defined

Housing is considered affordable when a household spends **no more than 30% of their gross income** on housing costs (rent or mortgage + taxes + insurance). This is the standard used by federal programs and housing policy nationwide.

When households spend more than 30%, they're considered **"cost-burdened"**—meaning less money for food, healthcare, transportation, and savings.

### The Reality in Archuleta County

| Household | What They Can Afford | What Housing Costs | The Gap |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Anna** (healthcare, 50% AMI) | $1,050/mo rent | $2,783/mo median rent | **-$1,733/mo** |
| **Mike & Jenny** (family, 100% AMI) | ~$385,000 home | $553,500 median home | **-$168,500** |
| **Linda & Tom** (retirees, 80% AMI) | ~$245,000 home | $350,000+ smallest available | **-$105,000+** |
| **Pat & Chris's workers** | $750-875/mo rent | $2,783/mo median rent | **-$1,900+/mo** |

### What These Gaps Mean

**For Anna:** She'd need to earn $111,000/year—nearly triple her salary—to afford the median rent at 30% of income. So she spends closer to 50% of her income on housing, leaving little for savings or emergencies.

**For Mike & Jenny:** Even at 100% AMI, they can't afford the median home. They'd need to find a home at $385,000 or less—rare in today's market.

**For Linda & Tom:** They earn too much for subsidized senior housing, but can't find anything smaller to buy. So they stay in their 3-bedroom home, unable to free it up for a family who needs it.

**For Pat & Chris's workers:** When a restaurant can't find line cooks because they'd need to earn $111,000 to afford median rent, the restaurant closes early. The worker, the business, and the community all lose.

### The Bigger Picture

- **44-48% of Archuleta County households are cost-burdened**—spending more than 30% of income on housing
- **Rental vacancy rate: 0.5%**—a healthy market has 5-7%. Ours is essentially closed.
- **Median rent increased 57%** since 2012
- **Median home price increased 56%** since 2020

---

### Learn More: What Is AMI?

**Area Median Income (AMI)** is the middle point of all household incomes in our area—half of households earn more, half earn less. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI for every county each year.

**For Archuleta County in 2025 (2-person household):**
- 100% AMI = $81,600/year
- 80% AMI = $65,300/year (often called "low income" in housing programs)
- 50% AMI = $40,800/year (often called "very low income")

**Why does this matter?** Most housing programs use AMI to determine who qualifies for assistance. If you earn "80% AMI," you might qualify for certain programs. This doesn't mean you're struggling—it means you earn 80% of what the median household earns.

### Reflection

**How does this affordability gap show up in our community?**

- [ ] I see this affecting workers I know
- [ ] I see this affecting families in our community
- [ ] I see businesses struggling to hire
- [ ] I see longtime residents having to leave

## Chapter 3: It Affects All of Us

Pat & Chris's story isn't unique. Housing affects more than just the people looking for a place to live—it affects our whole community.

### What We're Hearing

In the 2024 Housing Needs Assessment employer survey:

| Finding | Number |
|---------|--------|
| **Employers citing housing as their #1 hiring barrier** | 60% |
| **Employers citing cost of living as recruitment barrier** | 67% |
| **Positions unfilled at peak tourism season** | ~17% |
| **Workers commuting in from other communities** | 1,456 |

### The Jobs-Housing Imbalance

Pagosa Springs has **3.5 jobs for every working household**. This is one of the most extreme ratios in Colorado.

What does that mean? It means our economy needs more workers than can live here. Businesses compete for a limited pool of residents. Workers commute from Durango, Bayfield, and beyond. And some jobs simply go unfilled.

### How It Shows Up in Our Community

- **As employers:** Can't find workers to fill essential positions
- **As patrons:** Favorite restaurants close early, healthcare has longer waits
- **As neighbors:** Longtime residents forced to move away
- **As taxpayers:** Emergency services understaffed, schools struggle to hire
- **As community members:** Less diverse, less vibrant community

**When workers can't live here, businesses can't operate here—and our community loses what makes it special.**

### ⓘ Dig Deeper: Employment Data
- **Total jobs:** 7,523 (projected 8,069 by 2034)
- **3.5 jobs per working household** (extreme ratio)
- **20% of workforce commutes in daily** (1,456 workers)
- **63% of employers** say hiring has gotten harder

- Accommodation & food services
- Retail
- Healthcare
- Seasonal positions

### Reflection

**If you're an employer or work with one: What have you observed?**

- [ ] Housing seems to affect hiring in our area
- [ ] I've seen candidates back out due to housing
- [ ] Many employees commute long distances
- [ ] I've noticed service impacts (shorter hours, longer waits)

## Chapter 4: We're Not Starting From Scratch

Good news: our community has already taken steps to address housing. Let's look at what's happening—and how it connects to our four households.

### Current Programs & Partners

#### For Anna (Healthcare Worker, ~50% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **Housing Choice Vouchers** — Rental assistance for eligible households (program currently at capacity with ~30 vouchers)
- **Hickory Ridge Apartments** — 40 units for households at 60% AMI or below
- **Rose Mountain Townhomes** — 34 new units at 30-60% AMI (opened 2024)

**The gap:** Waitlists are long. Supply is limited. Anna earns slightly too much for some programs but not enough for market rent.

---

#### For Mike & Jenny (Working Family, ~100% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **HomesFund Down Payment Assistance** — Second mortgages of $15,000-$50,000 for 60-120% AMI buyers
- **Pagosa Springs CDC Workforce Housing** — Chris Mountain development offering homes in the $350,000 range
- **Habitat for Humanity** — Affordable homeownership (1-3 homes/year; waitlist exists)

**The gap:** Even at 100% AMI, they can't afford the median home. Down payment assistance helps but can't bridge a $168,000+ gap.

---

#### For Linda & Tom (Retirees, ~80% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **Casa de los Arcos** — 16 senior units at 0-30% AMI
- **Socorro Senior Living** — 19 senior units at 0-30% AMI
- **Archuleta Seniors, Inc.** — Aging-in-place support services

**The gap:** Very limited smaller housing stock. They earn too much for subsidized senior housing, but can't find anything smaller to buy.

---

#### For Pat & Chris (Employers)

**What could help:**
- **HOWL Program** (new 2025) — Employer-linked rental and utility assistance for workforce at 80-120% AMI
- **Workforce housing developments** — Pipeline projects include Pagosa Views, Timberline Apartments, and The Enclave with deed-restricted units

**The gap:** No existing employer-assisted housing program. HOWL is a pilot. Large-scale workforce housing is still years away.

---

### What's in the Pipeline

About **1,100 housing units** are in various stages of planning and development:

| Project | Units | Affordability | Timeline |
|---------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Pagosa Views | 650 | 10% deed-restricted (60-140% AMI) | 2026 start, 7-15 year buildout |
| Timberline Apartments | 100 | LIHTC (30-80% AMI) | 2026-2030 |
| The Enclave | 70 | Deed-restricted (60-90% AMI) | 2027 start |
| Pagosa Peaks | 96 | 10% deed-restricted | 2027 start |
| Chris Mountain Phase 2 | 50 | Workforce housing | 2024-2031 |

**The good news:** If these projects move forward, they could meet much of the projected need.

**The catch:** Most serve moderate- to higher-income households. Fewer address the 30-60% AMI gap.

### ⓘ Dig Deeper: Pipeline Details
- **~1,100 units** in various stages of planning
- **~180 units** expected to complete 2025-2027
- **Gap requiring public effort:** ~200 units (primarily <80% AMI)

### ⓘ Dig Deeper: Existing Affordable Inventory
**Total income-restricted units: 121**
- **Casa de Los Arcos:** 16 units (Senior, 0-30% AMI)
- **Rose Mountain Townhomes:** 34 units (30-60% AMI)
- **Socorro Senior Living:** 19 units (Senior, 0-30% AMI)
- **Hickory Ridge Apartments:** 40 units (≤60% AMI)
- **Other:** 12 units (various programs)

*Source: Strategy Group Session 1 Packet*

---

### Existing Policy Framework

Both the Town and County have established housing as a priority:

- **Archuleta County Strategic Plan (2025)** — "Address Affordable Cost of Living" is a strategic initiative
- **Town Vision 2050 (2025)** — Explicitly identifies housing affordability as a top community challenge
- **Short-term rental regulations** — Both jurisdictions require permits
- **ADU policies** — Accessory dwelling units permitted in both jurisdictions
- **Fee waivers** — Available for qualifying affordable projects

---

### Reflection

**Which of these programs or resources did you already know about?**

- [ ] Housing Choice Vouchers
- [ ] Down payment assistance (HomesFund)
- [ ] Workforce housing developments (Chris Mountain, etc.)
- [ ] Senior housing options
- [ ] Fee waivers for affordable projects
- [ ] None of these / I didn't know about any

## Thank You

Thank you for taking time to engage with this story. Your input matters.

Housing policy can feel overwhelming, but it comes down to a simple question: **Can the people who make our community work—healthcare workers, teachers, restaurant staff, seniors who've lived here for decades—afford to live here?**

Right now, for too many, the answer is no. The Housing Action Plan is our chance to change that.

**Your story is part of this story.** Thank you for sharing it.
