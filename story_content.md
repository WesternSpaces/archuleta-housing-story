# Housing in Archuleta County: Follow the Story

*An interactive guide to understanding our housing challenge*

---

## Introduction

Housing policy can feel abstract—full of acronyms, statistics, and policy jargon. But behind every number is a person, a family, a business trying to make it work here.

This story follows four households through the data. They're not real people, but they represent real situations in our community. As you read, consider: **Which household feels most familiar to you?**

---

## Chapter 1: Meet Your Neighbors

### Maria: The Healthcare Worker

**Who she is:** Maria is 34, a Certified Nursing Assistant at Pagosa Springs Medical Center. She's been here five years, loves the community, and is great at her job. She earns $42,000 a year—about 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI).

**Her situation:** Maria rents a one-bedroom apartment and works extra shifts when she can. She's looked at buying, but the math doesn't work. She's considered leaving for Durango, where some of her coworkers commute from, but she doesn't want to spend two hours a day in a car.

**What she can afford:**
- Maximum rent: $1,050/month (30% of income)
- Maximum home price: Out of reach

---

### The Garcias: The Young Family

**Who they are:** Carlos and Elena Garcia are in their late 30s with two kids in elementary school. Carlos is a deputy sheriff ($65,000), Elena is a teacher's aide ($28,000). Combined household income: $93,000—about 80% AMI for a family of four.

**Their situation:** They've been renting a three-bedroom house for six years. The landlord just told them he's selling—and the new owner may not keep it as a rental. They've started looking to buy, but listings under $400,000 are rare, and what's available needs major work.

**What they can afford:**
- Maximum rent: $2,325/month
- Maximum home price: ~$350,000

---

### The Rodriguezes: The Restaurant Owners

**Who they are:** Miguel and Teresa Rodriguez have run a restaurant downtown for twelve years. They're not looking for housing themselves—they own their home. But they can't find workers.

**Their situation:** Last summer, they had to close two days a week because they couldn't staff the kitchen. Line cooks, servers, dishwashers—they all need housing, and there's nothing available. When they do find applicants, many back out once they see rental prices. Miguel has considered buying a property to rent to employees, but the numbers don't pencil out.

**The impact:** "We've turned away business. We've shortened hours. It's not a labor problem—it's a housing problem."

---

### Robert: The Retiring Teacher

**Who he is:** Robert, 67, taught at Pagosa Springs Middle School for 25 years. He retired two years ago and lives on Social Security plus a modest pension—about $32,000/year, roughly 40% AMI.

**His situation:** Robert owns his home, but it's more house than he needs now. He'd like to downsize to something smaller and more accessible—maybe a condo or apartment—and free up equity for retirement. But there's nothing like that on the market. Meanwhile, his property taxes keep rising with home values. He's staying put, but he worries about maintaining the house as he ages.

**What he could afford:**
- Maximum rent: $800/month
- Maximum home price: ~$120,000 (if he downsized)

---

### Reflection

**As you read through these four households, which one feels most familiar to your situation—or to someone you know?**

- [ ] Maria (healthcare worker, can't afford rent)
- [ ] The Garcias (working family, trying to buy)
- [ ] The Rodriguezes (employer, can't find workers)
- [ ] Robert (senior, limited options to downsize)
- [ ] None of these / Other

---

## Chapter 2: The Math Doesn't Work

Let's follow each household through the affordability calculation.

### How "Affordable" Is Defined

Housing is considered affordable when a household spends **no more than 30% of their gross income** on housing costs (rent or mortgage + taxes + insurance). This is the standard used by federal programs and housing policy nationwide.

When households spend more than 30%, they're considered **"cost-burdened"**—meaning less money for food, healthcare, transportation, and savings.

### The Reality in Archuleta County

| What They Earn | What They Can Afford | What Housing Costs | The Gap |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------|
| **Maria** ($42,000/yr) | $1,050/mo rent | $2,783/mo median rent | **-$1,733/mo** |
| **The Garcias** ($93,000/yr) | ~$350,000 home | $553,500 median home | **-$203,500** |
| **Robert** ($32,000/yr) | $800/mo rent | $2,783/mo median rent | **-$1,983/mo** |

**The Rodriguezes** aren't looking for housing—but their employees are. A line cook earning $35,000 can afford $875/month. A server earning $30,000 can afford $750/month. The median rent is $2,783.

### What These Gaps Mean

**For Maria:** She'd need to earn $111,000/year—nearly triple her salary—to afford the median rent at 30% of income. So she spends closer to 50% of her income on housing, leaving little for savings or emergencies.

**For the Garcias:** They'd need to find a home at $350,000 or less. In 2024, only 12% of homes sold in Archuleta County were under $400,000.

**For Robert:** If he had to rent, he'd need subsidized senior housing. The waitlist at Casa de los Arcos is measured in years.

**For the Rodriguezes' employees:** They commute from Durango. Or they double up in overcrowded housing. Or they don't take the job at all.

### The Bigger Picture

- **44-48% of Archuleta County households are cost-burdened**—spending more than 30% of income on housing
- **Rental vacancy rate: 0.5%**—a healthy market has 5-7%. Ours is essentially closed.
- **Median rent increased 57%** since 2012
- **Median home price increased 56%** since 2020

---

### Learn More: What Is AMI?

**Area Median Income (AMI)** is the middle point of all household incomes in our area—half of households earn more, half earn less. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) calculates AMI for every county each year.

**For Archuleta County in 2025 (2-person household):**
- 100% AMI = $81,600/year
- 80% AMI = $65,300/year (often called "low income" in housing programs)
- 50% AMI = $40,800/year (often called "very low income")

**Why does this matter?** Most housing programs use AMI to determine who qualifies for assistance. If you earn "80% AMI," you might qualify for certain programs. This doesn't mean you're struggling—it means you earn 80% of what the median household earns.

---

### Reflection

**Have you experienced this affordability gap?**

- [ ] Yes, I'm struggling with housing costs myself
- [ ] Someone I know is struggling
- [ ] I see this affecting my community/workplace
- [ ] I haven't experienced this directly

## Chapter 3: It's Not Just Personal—It's Economic

The Rodriguezes' story isn't unique. Housing is the top barrier to hiring in Archuleta County.

### What Employers Are Telling Us

In the 2024 Housing Needs Assessment employer survey:

| Finding | Number |
|---------|--------|
| **Employers citing housing as their #1 hiring barrier** | 60% |
| **Employers citing cost of living as recruitment barrier** | 67% |
| **Positions unfilled at peak tourism season** | ~17% |
| **Workers commuting in from other communities** | 1,456 |

### The Jobs-Housing Imbalance

Pagosa Springs has **3.5 jobs for every working household**. This is one of the most extreme ratios in Colorado.

What does that mean? It means our economy needs more workers than can live here. Businesses compete for a limited pool of residents. Workers commute from Durango, Bayfield, and beyond. And some jobs simply go unfilled.

### Real Impacts

- **Restaurants close early** because they can't staff the kitchen
- **Healthcare facilities limit services** because nurses and CNAs can't find housing
- **Schools struggle to hire** teachers and support staff
- **Contractors turn down work** because they can't find laborers
- **Retail stores operate understaffed** during peak season

### The Economic Chain Reaction

Every unfilled position is:
- A business that can't serve customers
- A service that goes unprovided
- A tax base that doesn't expand
- A community that can't grow sustainably

**When workers can't live here, businesses can't operate here.**

---

### For Employers

**If you're an employer, what's your experience?**

- [ ] Housing is our biggest hiring challenge
- [ ] We've lost candidates due to housing
- [ ] Employees commute long distances
- [ ] We've considered providing or subsidizing housing
- [ ] Housing hasn't significantly affected our hiring

## Chapter 4: We're Not Starting From Scratch

Good news: our community has already taken steps to address housing. Let's look at what's happening—and how it connects to our four households.

### Current Programs & Partners

#### For Maria (Healthcare Worker, ~50% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **Housing Choice Vouchers** — Rental assistance for eligible households (program currently at capacity with ~30 vouchers)
- **Hickory Ridge Apartments** — 40 units for households at 60% AMI or below
- **Rose Mountain Townhomes** — 34 new units at 30-60% AMI (opened 2024)

**The gap:** Waitlists are long. Supply is limited. Maria earns slightly too much for some programs but not enough for market rent.

---

#### For the Garcias (Working Family, ~80% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **HomesFund Down Payment Assistance** — Second mortgages of $15,000-$50,000 for 60-120% AMI buyers
- **Pagosa Springs CDC Workforce Housing** — Chris Mountain development offering homes in the $350,000 range
- **Habitat for Humanity** — Affordable homeownership (1-3 homes/year; waitlist exists)

**The gap:** Few homes exist at their price point. Down payment assistance helps but can't bridge a $200,000+ gap between what they can afford and median price.

---

#### For the Rodriguezes (Employers)

**What could help:**
- **HOWL Program** (new 2025) — Employer-linked rental and utility assistance for workforce at 80-120% AMI
- **Workforce housing developments** — Pipeline projects include Pagosa Views, Timberline Apartments, and The Enclave with deed-restricted units

**The gap:** No existing employer-assisted housing program. HOWL is a pilot. Large-scale workforce housing is still years away.

---

#### For Robert (Senior, ~40% AMI)

**What could help:**
- **Casa de los Arcos** — 16 senior units at 0-30% AMI
- **Socorro Senior Living** — 19 senior units at 0-30% AMI
- **Archuleta Seniors, Inc.** — Aging-in-place support services

**The gap:** Very limited senior housing stock. Long waitlists. Few options between "stay in your house" and "move away."

---

### What's in the Pipeline

About **1,100 housing units** are in various stages of planning and development:

| Project | Units | Affordability | Timeline |
|---------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Pagosa Views | 650 | 10% deed-restricted (60-140% AMI) | 2026 start, 7-15 year buildout |
| Timberline Apartments | 100 | LIHTC (30-80% AMI) | 2026-2030 |
| The Enclave | 70 | Deed-restricted (60-90% AMI) | 2027 start |
| Pagosa Peaks | 96 | 10% deed-restricted | 2027 start |
| Chris Mountain Phase 2 | 50 | Workforce housing | 2024-2031 |

**The good news:** If these projects move forward, they could meet much of the projected need.

**The catch:** Most serve moderate- to higher-income households. Fewer address the 30-60% AMI gap.

---

### Existing Policy Framework

Both the Town and County have established housing as a priority:

- **Archuleta County Strategic Plan (2025)** — "Address Affordable Cost of Living" is a strategic initiative
- **Town Vision 2050 (2025)** — Explicitly identifies housing affordability as a top community challenge
- **Short-term rental regulations** — Both jurisdictions require permits
- **ADU policies** — Accessory dwelling units permitted in both jurisdictions
- **Fee waivers** — Available for qualifying affordable projects

---

### Reflection

**Which of these programs or resources did you already know about?**

- [ ] Housing Choice Vouchers
- [ ] Down payment assistance (HomesFund)
- [ ] Workforce housing developments (Chris Mountain, etc.)
- [ ] Senior housing options
- [ ] Fee waivers for affordable projects
- [ ] None of these / I didn't know about any

## Thank You

Thank you for taking time to engage with this story. Your input matters.

Housing policy can feel overwhelming, but it comes down to a simple question: **Can the people who make our community work—healthcare workers, teachers, restaurant staff, seniors who've lived here for decades—afford to live here?**

Right now, for too many, the answer is no. The Housing Action Plan is our chance to change that.

**Your story is part of this story.** Thank you for sharing it.
