## The Story

An interactive narrative following 5 households through the housing crisis:

1. **Anna** - Healthcare worker, can't afford rent ($1,050/mo gap)
2. **Mike & Jenny** - Young family, can't find a home to buy ($168,500 gap)
3. **Linda & Tom** - Retirees wanting to downsize, limited options
4. **Pat & Chris** - Restaurant owners, can't find workers (employer perspective)
5. **Sam** - Seasonal worker facing housing instability

This restores the **employer perspective** missing from Echo's boards and uses **correct HNA data** (median rent $2,783, not the lower averages).
