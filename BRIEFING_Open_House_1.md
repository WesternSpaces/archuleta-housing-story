## The Grassroots Survey (Rachel Suh, April 2025)

A local resident named **Rachel Suh** conducted an independent survey that got **233 responses in 7 days** (compared to the HNA's 600 responses over 3 months). Key findings you should know:

**What people are frustrated about:**
- **66%** believe county/town strategy doesn't reflect working families' priorities
- **69%** feel land use regulations worsen affordability
- **70%** concerned about short-term rental impacts
- High permitting/hookup fees cited as major barrier

**What they want:**
- **82%** support fee waivers for people building affordable primary residences
- **86%** favor pausing grants for higher-income earners until lower-income workers get help first
- **56%** support redirecting lodging taxes toward workforce housing

**The critique:** The survey reflects frustration that previous housing initiatives haven't delivered, and that outside investment gets prioritized over current residents' needs.

## Bill Hudson's Editorial Series (Pagosa Daily Post)

Bill Hudson is a local columnist who has written extensively (and critically) about housing. He's also on the PAWSD board. **Expect his readers at your event.** His main arguments:

1. **"We don't have a housing shortage, we have an affordability shortage"** - Estimates suggest ~25% of homes are vacant on any given day; the issue is that workers can't afford what exists

2. **20 years of studies, no action** - Housing studies were done in 2005, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2022, and now 2025. Problem keeps getting worse.

3. **Misaligned development** - Half of ~90 annual new homes serve as second homes/vacation rentals/retiree housing, not workforce housing

4. **Critiques PSCDC's "workforce housing"** - Points out that a $395,000 home requires ~$115,000 income + $60,000 down payment. Only 16% of Pagosa families and 38% of county families qualify.

5. **Town parcels still vacant** - The Town bought 3 parcels (5 acres) since 2019 for workforce housing but nothing has been built

## PSCDC/Chris Mountain Challenges

**What happened:**
- PSCDC built 10 homes in 2024 at $320,000-$390,000 (with $55,000 state grants per home)
- **Finding qualified buyers was extremely difficult** - needed 80-100% AMI income but also ability to swing a $330,000 mortgage
- 9 of 10 sold, but it took longer than expected

**2025-2026 plans scaled back:**
- Originally planned 10 homes/year for 2024, 2025, 2026
- **Now scaled back to 5 homes in 2026** due to sales difficulties
- This caused "considerable heartburn" because they'd promised 10/year to grant funders

## PAWSD Fee Waiver Controversy

A **contentious issue** that divided the PAWSD board:

- Capital Investment Fees (CIF) for water/sewer were $6,532 per home in 2023
- **Now $25,395 per home** after 2024 and 2025 increases
- Board voted 4-1 to approve waivers for Habitat for Humanity (80% AMI households)
- Board voted to **deny** waivers for two other projects at same meeting
- Board has since decided to **end the affordable housing surcharge** that funded the waivers

**Bill Hudson's position:** He supported adding budget for Habitat waivers in 2026

## SolidGround Solutions (December 2025)

**New development:** A Colorado Springs nonprofit wants to purchase **Pagosa Springs Apartments (98 units)** at 519 Village Drive (former motel conversion).

- Plans to offer 60-70% AMI rents
- Both County and Town issued letters of support
- Current units are 339 sq ft renting for $1,300/month - same as market-rate 725 sq ft units

**Concern raised:** Tourism/retail workers earning $30,000-35,000 still can't afford even deed-restricted rates

## Pagosa Views Project Stalled

Local developers Lyndon Hansen and Andrew McFarland have an 80-acre project approved for ~800 mixed-use units (10% workforce), but:

- **$1.8-1.9 million** of their own money tied up
- "Sold our houses, moved" to pursue it
- Can't secure lending or capital partners
- Impact fees alone are ~$30,000/unit
- Need CDOT involvement for highway access

## Short-Term Rentals

- **~1,000 local properties** have converted to vacation rentals
- Town limits STRs to 10% of housing units in residential zones
- 250-foot radius requirement from existing STRs

- Permits are non-transferable

## Hot-Button Topics to Be Ready For

1. **"Why another study?"** - People have seen multiple housing assessments with no results

2. **"Who actually qualifies for workforce housing?"** - The 80-100% AMI sweet spot is hard to hit

3. **"What about lower-income workers?"** - Tourism/retail workers (30-60% AMI) feel overlooked

4. **Fee waivers** - Should utility districts subsidize housing? Contentious.

5. **STR blame** - Many residents blame vacation rentals for the crisis

6. **Town's vacant parcels** - Why hasn't the Town built on land purchased in 2019?

7. **"We need rentals, not ownership"** - HNA shows 344 rental units needed; most projects focus on ownership

## Framing the HAP Differently from Past Studies

When people ask "why another study?":

1. **HNA was required** - SB24-174 mandates it; we're first in state to comply
2. **HAP is about action, not more data** - We're turning findings into specific steps
3. **Community input shapes priorities** - That's why we're here tonight
4. **Implementation plan included** - Timelines, responsibilities, accountability
5. **Living document** - Will adapt as we learn what works

*Good luck tomorrow!*
